DCLED stands for Dream Cheeky LED

It's a small LED matrix display that can be connected to your computer via USB.

Jeff Jahr wrote a program for Linux to send message to this display. His code
can be found here and is actually necessary for this project:

Follow the make instructions and copy the binary to /usr/local/bin or someplace
else in your $PATH. Please note: libhid is not distributed with Debian or Ubuntu
anymore so you need to install that separately as well. You can get it here:
http://libhid.alioth.debian.org/ (As of September 2011 it still works with the
version from SVN.)

The state tracker consists of two parts. One program acts as a demon and
continously displays messages that it receives from a client script.

To use it just start "php tracker.php" and let it run (e.g. in a virtual
terminal with "screen").

The send the messages with "php client <slot> <message>" where <slot> is a
number from 1 to 8 and determines the preamble shown for this message.
